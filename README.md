# JS_practice_Assignment1_FabioWeck

Assignment Overview

This assignment includes number of different works. Make sure you start working on it from the day it is assigned for you. In this programming assignment, we ask you to create a set of JavaScript functions and objects, then demonstrate that they operate correctly.  You can use any editor to write the functions.

Directions: 
•	Save any of your JavaScript file with the following naming format   A1_FirstName_filename.js   (filename means any word you would like to use to name the file. For example   : - a1_John_index.js  could be valid file name format)
•	All the function should be written in this single JS file only. For this assignment multiple JS file is not necessary.
•	It is highly recommended for you to create your own CSS file instead of embedding others style like bootstrap and others. 
•	When you finish, compress all the file in one and upload on d2l Assignment1 dropbox. Include a video recording of your working web application demo

This is a coding assignment, so all the rules about best coding practice apply.  Your code is evaluated for correctness (does it achieve the task it is supposed to) and for hygiene (is it clear, well-commented, and easy to follow).  There is no point in writing accurate code that nobody else can understand.  Some tips to ensure good code hygiene:

●	Add documentation about you on the very top of your code. Something similar to
/**
 * @name: Assignement1
 * @Course Code: SODV1201
 * @class: Software Development Diploma program.
 * @author: Your Full Name.  
 */
●	Add intelligent comments that explain your logic for each code
●	Add intelligent comments before expressions, methods, functions and classes to outline what they do
●	Use sensible variable names that match the purpose of a variable
●	Use whitespace between functions and code blocks and indent consistently
